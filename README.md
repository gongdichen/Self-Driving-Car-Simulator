# Self-Driving-Car-Simulator
Deep Learning Behaviour Cloning for Self-Driving Car Simulator
[Udacity Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/drive)


This README describes how the model was trained and what the characteristics of the dataset are. Information such as how the dataset was generated and video of the images from the training dataset and the simulations are included.    

## The results
Let's start with the fun part. The model was able to learn from training set based only on the first track. It learned to drive safely and smoothly through the whole track. Also, the model generalized and is able to drive very well on the second track.

You can see the simulation driving in the following videos:

## Creation of the training dataset
The udacity self-driving-car simulator was used to generate train and CV image sets including the steering angle. <br/>
For generating the dataset I played the game on the first track only. The game resolution while playing was 640x480 with lowest quality details. The game produces images from _center_, _left_, and _right_ angle cameras and the angle position of the steering wheel in training mode, writing the images path and steering angle of the current frame to a csv file.
For the train set, I used my own recorded data from track one, including _recovery data_ and also used the training data provided by _udacity_. Used the _left_ and _right_ images with manually augmented steering angle, except recovery data for additional train data - the model learned to aim for centering between the lanes. <br/>
The dataset preparation can be found in [Prepare Train Data.ipynb](Prepare%20Train%20Data.ipynb)

The total number of generated images for training is around 55k. <br/>
You can see a video of the full training set, including augmented steering angle in the following video: <br/>

<br/> _Sorry for the ^^ picture-link, README.md doesn't support video embeding._
<br/> You can see the recovery data after 14:03.

## Data preprocessing

Experimented a lot with preprocessing. The final version of the model doesn't resize the train image size. Uses the 3 RGB channels. Crops the top 60px from the image (mostly trees and skies). The data normalization is done by `x / 255 - 0.5` in the first layer of the NN.
Other things I tried and removed from the final model:

* Convert image to grayscale.
* Convert image to HSL color values.
* Crop pixels from bottom.
* Resize (downscaling) image and different crop sizes.

The preprocessing step can be seen in `load_img` function in [Train-the-model.ipynb](Train-the-model.ipynb)

## Model architecture

The final model consists of: <br/>
5 convolutional layers and 3 fully connected. Activation is elu, cost function is mse (regression) and optimizer is adam.

The final model code:
```
model = Sequential()
model.add(Lambda(normalize, input_shape=input_shape))
model.add(Convolution2D(16, 5, 5, subsample=(2, 2), border_mode='valid', activation='elu'))
model.add(Convolution2D(32, 5, 5, subsample=(2, 2), border_mode='valid', activation='elu'))
model.add(Convolution2D(64, 5, 5, subsample=(2, 2), border_mode='valid', activation='elu'))
model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, subsample=(2, 2), border_mode='valid', activation='elu'))
model.add(Convolution2D(64, 3, 3, subsample=(2, 2), border_mode='valid', activation='elu'))
model.add(Flatten())
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(256, activation='elu'))
model.add(Dropout(0.5))
model.add(Dense(10, activation='elu'))
model.add(Dense(1))

adam = Adam(lr=0.0001)
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer=adam)
model.summary()
```

And the leayers shapes:

## Training and evaluation

During model selection, I tried manually many different configurations of the model.
For cross-validation, I used `train_test_split` with 5% of the images held out for validation.

Things I tried:

* Activations: relu, elu, tanh, sigmoid
* Final layer: no activation, tanh activation [-1; 1]. Classification, where output is binned to 21 classes between -1 and 1.
* Learning rate values, batch sizes, and epochs.
* Architecture of the NN - different configurations of layers and sizes. 

The model training step uses a generator for the data, so not all images are stored in memory.
In the batch generator, I always augment the second half of the images, by flipping the image by the y-axis and taking the negative of the steering angle. This way the proportion of left and right steering angles balances.

The final model is trained for 20 epochs using 256 batch size. Cross validation showed this is the point where both train and cv loss are at their minimum.

<h4 id="running-the-simulator">Running the Simulator</h4>
<p>Once you’ve downloaded it, extract it and run it.</p>
<p>When you first run the simulator, you’ll see a configuration screen asking what size and graphical quality you would like. We suggest running at the smallest size and the fastest graphical quality. 
We also suggest closing most other applications (especially graphically intensive applications) on your computer, so that your machine can devote its resource to running the simulator.</p>
